/**
 * Tests for the profitability gate in [[PushAggregateThroughJoin]]: a pushed pre-aggregation is
 * kept when it crosses a join edge that has to shuffle, and otherwise only when it can be shown to
 * remove rows.
 *
 * The small fixtures below broadcast every dimension, so they exercise the cardinality half of the
 * gate: they are sized so the dimension row counts, which bound the distinct counts of the fact
 * table's foreign keys, either stay well below the fact row count (the pre-aggregation reduces) or
 * multiply past it (it does not). `profitabilityCheckMinRows` is lowered to 1 for them, since the
 * check is otherwise skipped at these sizes. The warehouse-scale tests further down cover the
 * shuffling-edge half with the shipped defaults.
